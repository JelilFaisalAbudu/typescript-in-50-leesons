# TYPESCRIPT IN 50 LESSONS - LESSON THREE: TYPES

In this lesson we're going to learn about how to use the TypeScript's types and shapes in conjunction with JSDoc to further improve on our vanilla JavaScript code.

Because we can't write TypeScript in a .js file, we use the JSDoc as a way to annotate our code using comments.

JSDoc annotation comment is different from the usual way we add comments to our code. In JSDoc, you place comments in between `/**` and `*/` characters.

**JSDoc example:**
```
/**
Your JSDoc comments live here.
*/
```

## Key Takeaways

- JSDoc helps to add types to variables in our JavaScript files.

- JSDoc type annotation enables TypeScript know much more about the semantics of our program

- Apart from the primitive types, we can define our own custom types with the help of JSDoc.
