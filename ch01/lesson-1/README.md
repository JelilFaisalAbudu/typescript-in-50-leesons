# TYPESCRIPT IN 50 LESSONS - CHAPTER ONE

In this chapter, we learn about how to leverage on  the modern code editor's(in my case, it's VS Code) TypeScript extension to analyze our vanilla Javascript code.

In your vanilla JavaScript code, you can explicitly activate TypeSCript to point out potential errors before your code hit production environment.

To achieve this goal, you add the comment `//@ts-check` at the very top of the JavaScript file. By adding this simple line of comment, TypeScript becomes active in your JavaScript file and give you all the visual feedback in the form of red squiggly lines in your code as errors if any. It also gives you an explanation in a pop-up.

## The Main Concepts Of This Lesson

- Explicitely adding `//@ts-check` as the very first line of your JavaScript file to enhance your productivity even without knowing how to code in TypeScript.
