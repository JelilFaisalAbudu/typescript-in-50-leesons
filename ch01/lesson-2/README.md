# TYPESCRIPT IN 50 LESSONS - LESSON TWO: HUNTING BUGS

In lesson one we looked at how just by adding the `//@ts-check`, at the very top of your JavaScript file, TypeScript became active and listed all the problems in the code.

In this lesson, we continue with our expedition to fix the bugs that TypeScript listed for us in a separate JavaSCript file.

## Main Concepts Learnt

- **Type check**: making sure we deliver what's expected.

- **Type inference**: Deducing the type of value a variable was initialized with. This ensures that that variable get reassigned values of the same type forever.

- **Semantic checks**: For instance, ensuring that you don't reassign a constant variable.
